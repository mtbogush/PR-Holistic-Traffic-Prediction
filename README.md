# PR-Holistic Traffic Prediction for Smart Cities: A Full-Cycle Approach

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the operationalization of machine learning models for real-time traffic prediction using the METR-LA dataset. The goal is to experiment with models, deploy them in a scalable environment, and monitor their performance in a real-world context.

### Key Phases of the Project
1. **Phase 1:** Model Experimentation using Kubeflow
2. **Phase 2:** Model Deployment using Docker and Kubernetes
3. **Phase 3:** Model Monitoring using Evidently
4. **Phase 4:** Presentation of key findings and live Q&A

### Learning Outcomes
- Experiment and evaluate LSTM and another selected model on the METR-LA dataset.
- Deploy the models using Docker and Kubernetes.
- Implement real-time monitoring with an Evidently dashboard.
- Effectively communicate insights via video and live presentations.
