# Phase 1: Model Experimentation Using Kubeflow

## Objective
Experiment with LSTM and one other selected model (ARIMA, RNN, GRU, or DCRNN) on the METR-LA dataset using Kubeflow.

### Tasks
- **Model Building**: Implement LSTM and another model using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- **Experiment Tracking**: Track experiments with Kubeflow, logging parameters, metrics, and artifacts.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate models using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and RÂ².

### Deliverables
- `model_experimentation.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code and documentation for model experimentation.
- `kubeflow_logs.pdf`: Exported logs from Kubeflow tracking the experimentation process.
- `model_comparison_report.pdf`: Report comparing the performance of the two models.
- `starter_notebook_phase_1.py`: Starter code for model implementation.

### How to Run the Experiment
1. Open `model_experimentation.ipynb` and follow the instructions for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
2. Use Kubeflow for tracking experiment parameters and results.
