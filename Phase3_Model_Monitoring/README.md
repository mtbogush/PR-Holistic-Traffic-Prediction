# Phase 3: Model Monitoring Using Evidently

## Objective
Set up and implement model monitoring using a pre-configured Evidently dashboard.

### Tasks
- **Monitoring Setup**: Integrate Evidently with the deployed model to track performance and detect model drift.

### Deliverables
- `evidently_monitoring_setup.py`: Code for setting up the monitoring dashboard.
- `monitoring_dashboard_code/`: Contains the setup code for the dashboard.
- `video_presentation_link.txt`: Link to the video presentation.

### Monitoring Setup Instructions
1. Use the `evidently_monitoring_setup.py` script to set up the dashboard.
2. Monitor key metrics in real-time using the integrated Evidently dashboard.
